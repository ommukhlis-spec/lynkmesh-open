# LynkMesh Public Release Notes — v0.1

> **Release status: early validation / research preview.** LynkMesh is not production-ready. Expect breaking changes.

## What LynkMesh is

LynkMesh is a deterministic context protocol for AI-assisted code understanding.

Instead of feeding an AI agent raw files or relying on probabilistic retrieval, LynkMesh turns a codebase into a structured, evidence-linked, reproducible context layer that an agent can reason over safely.

The semantic contracts that make up the protocol perform no LLM inference — interpretation is left to the consuming agent, under explicit guardrails.

---

## What is included in this release

- **Graph serialization / graph payload foundation** — a deterministic serialized snapshot of the semantic code graph.
- **MeshContext Report** — a deterministic, machine-readable projection of the latest successful build (facts and candidates only; no inference).
- **MeshContext AI Context Pack** — a compact, token-conscious, evidence-linked projection of the report, in `compact`, `balanced`, and `expanded` profiles.
- **Token Benchmark with `source_baselines`** — deterministic token measurement calibrated against two baselines (`mesh_context_report` and `serialized_graph_payload`) so reduction is never read from a single source.
- **Structural Validation** — a semantic contract that checks consistency across the payload → report → AI pack → benchmark chain and asserts the privacy and determinism guarantees.
- **Public local CLI** — source-checkout commands for `doctor`, `report`, `pack`, and `benchmark`, using JSON stdout for artifact-producing commands and stderr for diagnostics.
- **Open-core safety export pipeline** — a curated, allow-listed export with an automated privacy/safety scan over the generated public output.

## Public CLI surface

The current public source checkout includes:

```bash
python -m lynkmesh doctor
python -m lynkmesh report <path>
python -m lynkmesh pack <path> --profile compact
python -m lynkmesh benchmark <path> --profile compact
python -m lynkmesh benchmark <path> --profiles compact,balanced,expanded
```

For `report`, `pack`, and `benchmark`:

- stdout is JSON
- stderr is reserved for diagnostics/progress messages
- no output file is written unless stdout is redirected
- generated artifacts contain no embedded LLM inference

The CLI is intended for local research-preview usage. It is not a production contract and does not imply PyPI distribution maturity.

---

## What is not included / current limitations

- **Not production-ready.** This is an early-validation research preview.
- **Not benchmark proof yet.** A passing run demonstrates the protocol works end-to-end deterministically; it is not a published performance benchmark.
- **No aggregate `risk_score` yet.** Risk is surfaced only as deterministic candidates.
- **No LLM inference inside the semantic contracts.** Every contract carries `contains_llm_inference = false`.
- **Token estimates are deterministic heuristics**, not tokenizer-exact counts and not model-specific billing figures.
- **Language/runtime coverage is still evolving.** PHP is partial / early alpha; framework magic and runtime behavior are not fully modeled; other languages fall back to structural-only results.

## Validation snapshot

The most recent recorded validation for this release candidate:

- Semantic contract tests: pass.
- MCP / internal validation suite: pass.
- Public CLI tests: pass.
- Public CLI smoke for `doctor`, `report`, `pack`, and `benchmark`: pass.
- Open-core dry-run safety scan: clean (warnings expected at the documented baseline; safety errors: 0).
- Open-core release-candidate smoke: passed.

## Dogfooding note

LynkMesh uses its own deterministic context outputs as evidence for release documentation, with human review.

The figures below come from running LynkMesh on its own repository through the validated MCP capabilities; they are deterministic facts, not LLM interpretation, and not a performance claim.

Sanitized self-analysis snapshot (illustrative, single run):

- capabilities: `feature_stage` 4.4.1; MeshContext Report, AI Context Pack, and Token Benchmark all enabled; token benchmark calibrated; AI pack privacy-safe; structural validation available.
- MeshContext Report status: ok; `node_count` 26; `edge_count` 53.
- AI Context Pack (compact) status: ok.
- Token Benchmark status: ok; `benchmark_source_kind`: `mesh_context_report`; `source_baselines`: `mesh_context_report`, `serialized_graph_payload`; calibration notes: 4.
- `guardrails.contains_llm_inference`: false across report, AI pack, and token benchmark.

These values describe the output shape on one small run; they are not a public benchmark or a guarantee.

---

## Privacy guarantees

- No `mesh_context_report.json` is written by default.
- CLI artifact commands write JSON only when stdout is redirected by the user.
- No private absolute paths or private project names are exposed in the protocol outputs.
- `contains_llm_inference = false` across all semantic contracts.
- The token benchmark embeds derived metrics only, never raw payloads.
